# Linear-and-Logistic-Regression

This project implements Logistic Regression algorithms from scratch using Python. The goal of this project is to provide a deeper understanding of these machine learning models by manually coding their mathematical foundations and optimization processes without relying on high-level libraries such as scikit-learn. The project will walk through the steps of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using these models.

Key Concepts Implemented:
Linear Regression:
A model used for predicting a continuous outcome variable (dependent variable) based on one or more input features (independent variables).
The model assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable.
Logistic Regression:
A classification algorithm used for binary classification problems where the output variable is categorical (e.g., 0 or 1).
The model uses the logistic function (sigmoid) to predict probabilities that map to classes.

# Technical Requirements
Python: The entire project is implemented using Python 3.x.
Libraries:
NumPy: For handling matrix operations and numerical calculations.
Matplotlib: For data visualization and plotting the regression line.
Pandas (optional): For data manipulation and loading datasets.
